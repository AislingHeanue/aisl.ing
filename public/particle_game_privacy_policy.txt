We are committed to privacy. The App does not collect, use, or share any personal information. This means we do not collect:

- Names
- Addresses
- Email addresses

Any other information that could be used to identify an individual.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App. We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically.
